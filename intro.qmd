# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is my book in which i attempt to figure out how my computer works.  My computer is a 
Macbook Air with an M2 chip, 24 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB SSD.  I chose to use my actual computer for this project for a few reasons.
One is that I have unfettered access to this computer.  Another is that it's an interesting and fairly modern (in 2024)
piece of hardware.  Mostly though, i wanted to use a specific computer because i want to talk about real hardware
and not abstractions.

My motive really _is_ to figure out how my ðŸ¤¬ computer works.  When i first got into computers way back in the 1970s
i was as interested in the hardware as the software, and there wasn't really that big of a separation between the two.
(I still have a paper manual with the assembly language of the BIOS of my first computer).
In the last 40 years the hardware has become vastly more complicated and the software has of necessity become more
abstract and conceptually distant from the hardware.

I see this as a programming book, and if there's an audience for it they are mostly programmers.  I often don't
explain things that are fairly technical, and i sometimes _do_ explain things that you already know.  The latter
happens because i'm trying to convince myself of something.  Also the tone is mostly informal, sarcastic,
dad-jokey, and nerd-positive.  I hope that the structure and sequence of the
"episodes" make sense, but it's dictated by what i want to learn next and the questions that arise when i'm trying to
figure things out.

Since this is a project of self-directed learning undertaken by someone who's not a hardware expert, or even an operating 
system expert, there will probably be mistakes and oversimplifications.  If you have constructive comments, or non-constructive 
criticisms that i might find amusing, please feel free to <a href="https://giraffasaur.us/coords">contact me</a>.
