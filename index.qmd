# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a book in which i attempt to figure out how my computer works.  My computer is a 
Macbook Air with an M2 chip, 24 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB SSD.  I chose to use my actual computer for a few reasons.
One is that I have unfettered access.  Another is that it's an interesting and fairly modern (in 2024)
piece of hardware.  Also, I wanted to use a specific computer because i want to talk about real hardware
and not abstractions.

My motive really _is_ to figure out how my ðŸ¤¬ computer works, however this isn't a book about hardware.
I see this as a programming book, and if there's an audience for it they are mostly programmers.  I often don't
explain things that are technical, and i sometimes _do_ explain things that you already know.  The latter
happens because i'm trying to convince myself of something.  Also the tone is mostly informal, sarcastic,
dad-jokey, and nerd-positive.  I hope that the structure and sequence of the
"episodes" make sense, but it's dictated by what i want to learn next and the questions that arise when i'm trying to
figure things out.

Since this is a project of self-directed learning undertaken by someone who's not a hardware expert, or even an operating 
system expert, there will probably be mistakes and oversimplifications.  If you have constructive comments, or non-constructive 
criticisms that i might find amusing, please feel free to <a href="https://giraffasaur.us/coords">contact me</a>.
